\chapter{Mössbauer spectra measurement}
The previous chapter compared the three detectors in their efficiency of detecting 14.4 keV photons. This chapter compares them in the efficiency of measuring the MS spectra. The good detection efficiency of 14.4 keV photons does not necessarily imply a good MS spectrum measurement efficiency and vice versa. Effects that do not correspond to 14.4 keV photon detection (e.g. Compton continuum) reduce the SNR of MS spectra. To determine this efficiency, a setup similar to that used for the MCA measurement is again used, with the addition of a sample with holder and transducer for Doppler energy modulation. The sample chosen for this measurement is K$_{3}[$Fe(CN)$_{6}]$, which is characterised by a singlet spectrum.
\par
The whole MS setup is controlled by the Mössbauer spectrometer unit controlled by the PC software \cite{STEJSKAL2019thesis}, both developed at DEP. The control unit drives the transducer, regulates its speed and also processes the incoming pulses from the detector. The control software also does all the data processing and acquires the MS spectrum data files that are analysed in this chapter.

\par
The detector output is routed directly to the MS spectrometer control unit where the channel interval for the MS spectrum measurement is selected. However, the previous MCA showed that the interval of the 14.4 keV peak is different for each detector, so in order to compare the detectors in MS efficiency, the channel interval must be selected according to the location of the 14.4 keV energy peak. We selected this interval as 90$\%$ of the FWHM of the 14.4 keV energy peak with respect to the results of the MCA measurement for each detector.
%The previous chapter compared the three detectors in detection efficiency of 14.4 keV photons. This chapter compares them in an efficiency of measuring the MS spectra. The good detection efficiency of 14.4 keV photons does not necessarily imply the good efficiency of MS spectra measurement and vice versa. Effects, which are not corresponding to the 14.4 keV photon detection (for example Compton continuum), decrease the SNR of MS spectra. To determine this efficiency, setup similar to the one intended for MCA measurement is used again, only sample with holder and transducer for Doppler energy modulation are added. As a sample for this measurement was chosen K$_{3}[$Fe(CN)$_{6}]$, which is characterized by a singlet spectrum.

However, the previous MCA showed that the interval of 14.4 keV peak is different for every detector, so, to compare the detectors in MS efficiency, the channel interval  has to be selected according to the location of 14.4 keV energy peak. We selected this interval as 90$\%$ of FWHM of 14.4 keV energy peak with respect to the results of MCA measurement for each detector.
\par
The transducer is very sensitive to vibration and must therefore be placed on the anti-vibration mat together with the detector and sample holder. Before the measurement, the velocity calibration routines provided by the control software must be run on the transducer to obtain the scaling coefficient, which is then used to recalculate the velocity axis from the arbitrary units to mm$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. 

\par
The MS spectrum for each detector can be seen in the figures \ref{Si PIN detector MS spectra.}, \ref{Gas detector MS spectra.} and \ref{Scintillator detector MS spectra.}. One MS spectrum was measured for 20 hours, including only the valid cycles where the velocity error did not exceed the defined limit.

Each spectrum is fitted by the Lorentzian in the form described by the equation \ref{lor}. However, when comparing the MS parameters between detectors, there was a problem with the different width of the line in each spectrum caused by the mechanical vibrations affecting the transducer. If the SNR$_{\textrm{MS}}$ and $E_{\textrm{MS}}$ (equations \ref{SNR} and \ref{effect}), which both depend on $I_{\textrm{MS}}$, are to be comparable between measurements, it is necessary to recalculate $I_{\textrm{MS}}$ for each Lorentzian with respect to the same line width. The recalculation is based on the following consideration: The altered velocity signal may cause the variations in $\Gamma$ of a singlet Lorentzian curve, but its area $A$ (total number of counts), given by the equation \ref{area}, should remain unchanged by this effect. Thus, if $A$ is conserved although $\Gamma$ is changed, the new amplitudes $I_{\textrm{rec}}$ corresponding to the recalculated Lorentzians with the same $\Gamma_{\textrm{ref}}$ can be obtained by a simple relation $I_{\textrm{rec}} = \frac{\Gamma}{\Gamma_{\textrm{ref}}}I_{\textrm{original}}$. The reference $\Gamma_{\textrm{ref}}$ is the lowest $\Gamma$ of the spectra.
The results obtained for each detector can be seen in the table \ref{mossres}.

The recalculation is based on the following consideration: The altered velocity signal can cause the variations in $\Gamma$ of a singlet Lorentzian curve, however, its area $A$ (total number of counts) given by equation \ref{area} should be left unchanged by this effect. So if the $A$ is conserved although the $\Gamma$ is changed, the new amplitudes $I_{\textrm{rec}}$ corresponding to the recalculated Lorentzians with the same $\Gamma_{\textrm{ref}}$  can be obtained by a simple relation $I_{\textrm{rec}} = \frac{\Gamma}{\Gamma_{\textrm{ref}}}I_{\textrm{original}}$. As a reference $\Gamma_{\textrm{ref}}$ is taken the smallest $\Gamma$ of the spectra.

%The results show that the best SNR$_{\textrm{MS}}$ has the scintillator detector, and thus when it comes to acquiring the MS spectra in transmission geometry, the Si PIN detector is not the best candidate. However, the highest $E_{\textrm{MS}}$ is associated with the Si PIN, and thus it can be employed in some applications where $E_{\textrm{MS}}$ is an important parameter.
