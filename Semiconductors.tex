\chapter{Semiconductor detectors with p-n junction}
% -----------------------------------------------
Semiconductor structures have unique properties that make them useful for more than just particle/photon detection. There are many types of semiconductor detectors, starting with conventional photoresistors and photodiodes for light intensity measurements with a spectral range from infrared to UV. For low intensities and single photon events there are avalanche photodiodes (APDs). When the whole image needs to be captured, matrix detectors such as CCD and CMOS cameras can be used. In nuclear and particle physics, semiconductor detectors for X-rays, gamma rays and other particles are becoming increasingly common. For more complex measurements, such as particle trajectories, matrix drift or strip detectors may be the right choice. For gamma spectroscopy, p-n junction detectors are essential.

To detect Mössbauer 14.4 keV gammas our primary choice are the Si PIN diodes for direct detection due to the high detection efficiency under 25 keV \cite{SiCdTe}. 

\section{The structure of semiconductor}
Individual atoms are characterised by the well-known discrete energy levels, but in the case of solid crystals there is another model to describe the energy levels - the band structure. In this model, the energy levels are so close to each other that they almost form a continuum. This difference in behaviour is due to a periodic potential within the crystal lattice. However, the electron energy $E_{n}$ is not the only quantum number that describes the behaviour of electrons within the periodic potential. By solving the Schrödinger equation using the so-called Bloch theorem, we conclude that the second important quantum number is the wave vector $\vec{k}$. These two quantum numbers are bounded by the dispersion relation $E = E(\vec{k})$, which is characteristic of each crystal and may play a role in the transition of electrons between bands.
%The single atoms are characterized by the well-known discrete energy levels, but in the case of solid crystals, there is another  model describing the energy levels - the band structure. In this model the energy levels are very close each other that they nearly form a continuum. This different behaviour is a result of a periodical potential inside the crystal lattice. However, the electron energy $E_{n}$ is not the only quantum number describing the behaviour of electrons inside the periodical potential. By solving Schrödinger equation with the help of so-called Bloch's theorem, we come to a conclusion that the second important quantum number is the wave vector $\vec{k}$. These two quantum numbers are bounded together by dispersion relations $E = E(\vec{k})$, which is characteristic for every crystal and may play role when it comes to transitions of electrons between bands.



\subsection{Direct and indirect semiconductors}
The shape of the dispersion relations $E(\vec{k})$ divides the semiconductors into two categories - direct and indirect semiconductors. For direct semiconductors the energy minimum in the conduction band and the energy maximum in the valence band have the same $\vec{k}$, so the transition can occur after the $E_{\textrm{g}}$ is supplied. In the case of indirect, the minimum and maximum have different $\vec{k}$. To make the transition, additional momentum must be supplied (e.g. by phonons) or the energy supplied must be much greater to allow the transition to the higher state. with the same $\vec{k}$.

%The Si crystal is an indirect semiconductor.


\subsection{Band structure}
The basic difference between conductors, insulators and semiconductors is the valence and conduction band structure. In conductors, the valence band overlaps the conduction band. The electrons in the conduction band can move almost freely throughout the crystal. For insulators, there is no overlap and the energy gap $E_{\textrm{g}}$ between the two bands is so large that it makes any electron transitions almost impossible. However, in the case of semiconductors, the $E_{\textrm{g}}$ is small enough to allow the electron to jump into the conduction band and leave the hole in the valence band after receiving enough energy - in the form of thermal energy $E_{\textrm{T}} = kT$, electric field $E_{\textrm{s}} = -e\phi$ or photon $E_{\textrm{photon}} = \hbar \omega$. The last one is the most important because it allows us to use semiconductors as detectors. Both the electron and the hole take part in the conduction.

The last one is the most important, because it allows us to use the semiconductors as detectors. Both the electron and hole participates on conduction.


\subsection{Occupation of states}
The occupation probability of states in the band structure is given by the Fermi-Dirac distribution, since the electrons are the fermions with the exclusion rules. The possible occupied state where the occupation probability falls below 50 $\%$ is called the Fermi level with Fermi energy $E_{\textrm{F}}$. 
For an ideal pure semiconductor at $T=0$ K the $E_{\textrm{F}}$ is in the centre of the band gap. With increasing temperature the Fermi level in most materials moves upwards towards the conduction band.

%For ideal pure semiconductor at $T=0$ K, the $E_{\textrm{F}}$ lies in the middle of the band gap. With increasing temperature, in most materials the Fermi-level moves upper towards the conduction band.

\subsection{Semiconductor Crystals}
Semiconductor materials are usually in the form of a crystal with a diamond structure (two FCC lattices bonded together), where the lattice atoms are bonded together by a covalent bond. However, in real crystals there are also defects and impurities that can change the functionality. The impurities can be intentionally added to enhance the desired properties in a process called doping. 
\par
There are several suitable materials for the construction of ionising radiation detectors. Among them the well-known is Ge, which has very good energy resolution but requires cooling. Another suitable material is Si. Si photodiodes have a high detection efficiency below 25 keV and are easy to manufacture, since many other semiconductor devices are made of Si. In the case of wide-spectrum x-ray and gamma-ray detectors, CdTe can provide sufficient parameters. The manufacture of semiconductors for detection purposes involves many complicated processes because the detector requirements for crystal purity are very high.

\section{The p–n junction}
Intrinsic semiconductors have a limited range of applications. We can alter the behaviour by adding specific impurities and create an extrinsic semiconductor. The Si atom has 4 valence electrons which form a covalent bond with other Si atoms. If the Si atom is replaced by an atom with 5 valence electrons, one of them will have a very weak bond.
By doping the intrinsic semiconductor with these atoms we create the $n$-type with additional electrons localised almost in the conduction band. However, the crystal as a whole remains neutral. Similarly, doping with atoms with only 3 valence electrons will create holes in the valence band - the $p$-type.
These atoms create energy levels in the band structure, but at room temperature they are all mostly ionised and participate in conduction. The full theoretical treatment of doping is very complex, taking into account many other quantum and statistical physics aspects, and is not useful for the purposes of this thesis. 

\par
The special effects arise when $p$-type and and $n$-type are bound together. The holes of the $p$ type and the electrons of the $n$ type will start to diffuse into the other region. However, this movement alters the charge density, leading to the creation of a built-in voltage, which in the end cancels out the diffusion. This creates the depleted region, where there are no free carriers. 
\par
Another theoretical view is that the electrons will rearrange because the Fermi level must be the same throughout the crystal, whereas for the stand-alone $p$ type the Fermi level is closer to the valence band and for the $n$ type closer to the conduction band. The potential created in this way equalises the different Fermi levels.

The potential created this way equalizes the different Fermi levels. 

\par
The p-n junction can be connected to the supply voltage ( known as a bias) in two ways. The first possibility is the forward connection - the $p$ layer to plus and $n$ to minus. Increasing the voltage in this type of connection causes the size of the depleted layer to decrease until it disappears completely (bias voltage is opposite to the built-in voltage). The absence of the depleted layer makes the p-n junction conductive. The second possibility is the reverse - $p$ to minus and $n$ to plus. Increasing the voltage also increases the size of the depletion layer (bias goes with the built-in voltage). Since the size of the depletion layer is crucial for detection, semiconductor detectors are operated in reverse connection.


\par
The p-n junction has many unique properties that are commonly used in the form of classical diodes. However, it is also crucial for detection because the free carriers (if produced at all) in the depleted layer are pushed towards the electrodes by the electric field and form a photocurrent.

\par
For design purposes in electronic circuits, detectors are usually modelled as classical p-n diodes connected to the bias source in the reverse direction. In the case of detection, the detector can also be modelled as a current source.


\par
The p-n junction has its characteristic capacitance, which depends on the size of the depleted layer and therefore on the bias voltage.
This capacitance plays an important role as it affects the dynamic parameters of the detection circuits and modifies the overall frequency spectra.
%The p-n junction can be connected to supply voltage (refereed as bias) in two ways. First possibility is the connection in the forward direction - the $p$ layer on plus and $n$ on minus. Increasing the voltage in this type of connection causes the reduction of the size of the depleted layer with  the until it completely vanishes (bias voltage goes against built-in voltage). The lack of the depleted layer makes the p-n junction conductive. Second possibility is the reverse direction - $p$ on minus and $n$ on plus. Increasing the voltage increases the size of depletion layer as well (bias goes with built-in voltage). Since the size of depletion layer is crucial for detection, the semiconductor detectors are operated in reverse direction.

%This capacitance plays a significant role since it affects the dynamical parameters of the detection circuits and alters the entire frequency spectra.

%There is also one more problem with the diffusion of electron and holes which has to be considered. It is the diffusion of charge carriers from the $p$ and $n$ layers to the metal ohmic contacts on electrodes, which can form an unwanted electric field and a potential barrier across the contact. To prevent this from happening, the regions around the ohmic contacts are highly doped to reduce the potential barrier size. 


\section{Detection mechanism}
The detection of a particle or photon is based on its interaction with the detector material - in semiconductors the formation of electron-hole pairs is observed. This can be achieved by the interaction mechanisms described in previous chapters, which differ for each type of particle and energy. In the case of low energy gamma, the two main mechanisms involved in the production of charge carriers are the photoeffect (internal) and Compton scattering.

\par
The main purpose of the semiconductor as a detector is to perform a linear conversion of the particle/photon energy into the free charge carriers - electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band. The average energy required to create a single electron-hole pair is usually a fixed constant - in Si it is $\epsilon = 3.6$ eV \cite{Lutz_2007}. Since Si is an indirect semiconductor, this value is not equal to the gap energy, which is lower ($E_{\textrm{g}} = 1.12$ eV).  

\par
The gamma photon hitting the detector first interacts with a single electron. When the photoeffect takes its place, the primary electron with an energy much higher than the thermal excitation will ionise electrons from all over the valence band, pushing them into higher states from the conduction band. These conduction band electrons de-excited to lower conduction band states and the holes redistributed to the upper valence band states. This de-excitation process releases energy and leads to a cascade of further excitations and interactions, producing many electron-hole pairs - the charge cloud. The number of generated electron-hole pairs $n$ is simply given by the relation:

The average energy needed to create a single electron-hole pair is usually a fix constant - in Si it is $\epsilon = 3.6$ eV \cite{Lutz_2007}. Since the Si is an indirect semiconductor, this value is not equal to gap energy, which is lower ($E_{\textrm{g}} = 1.12$ eV).

%The gamma photon striking the detector firstly interacts with a single electron. If the photo-effect takes its place, the primary electron with energy much higher than the thermal excitation will ionize the electrons from all over the valence band pushing them into higher states from conduction band. These Electrons in conduction band de-excite themselves into lower states of conduction band and the holes redistribute themselves to the upper states in valence band. This de-excitation process releases energy again and that leads to the cascade of further excitations and interactions, which produce many electron-hole pairs - the charge cloud. Number of generated electron-hole pairs $n$ is simply given by relation:


\begin{equation}
n = \frac{E_{\textrm{gamma}}}{\epsilon}.
\end{equation}

\par
Compton scattering results in energy distortion and gamma spectrum degradation. Compton without any other subsequent interaction (Compton again or photoeffect) is typical for thin detectors because there is not sufficient thickness to stop the scattered photon again.

\par
An ideal very thick detector could solve this problem, because all possible interactions and all subsequent sub-interactions would take place inside the detector, resulting in electron-hole generation. Such a detector would have only the full energy peaks without any other unwanted counts. However, the construction of such a detector is very complicated due to the many technical and manufacturing problems that arise with increasing dimensions. 

\par
In a p-n junction, the charge carriers generated in the depleted layer are pushed towards the electrodes by an internal electric field. The electronics accumulate the charge and convert it into a voltage pulse signal, which is then analysed to extract the energy information. Since the depleted layer is the only part where detection can occur, it is obvious that it should be as large as possible for detector purposes. 
\par
To achieve the larger dimensions of the detection part, the p-n junction can be upgraded to a p-i-n junction, which contains an additional intrinsic layer between the $p$ and $n$ parts, acting as a fixed size depleted layer. The detectors with p-i-n junction are called PIN photodiodes. The additional intrinsic layer reduces the capacitance but increases the time it takes for charge carriers to leave the detector.

\section{Main noise sources and resolution limitations}
Detection efficiency and energy resolution are strongly affected by noise that alters the signal. While some negative effects are caused by outside conditions such as temperature or by noise in the electronics, some originate strictly from the properties of the semiconductor material and can only be minimised during the preparation of the crystal.
%The detection efficiency and the energy resolution are strongly dependent on noise which alters the signal. While some negative effects are caused by outer conditions such as temperature or by noise in electronics, some originate strictly from semiconductor material properties and only chance to minimize them is during the crystal's preparation.

\subsection{Fano noise}
The physical effect within the semiconductor itself that limits the measured energy resolution is the fact that not all of the particle's energy is converted into charge carriers. A fraction of the energy can be consumed to induce lattice vibrations (phonons). Statistically, the relative resolution can be described by the following equation:
%The physical effect inside the semiconductor itself which limits the measured energy resolution is the fact that not all of the particle's energy is transformed into charge carriers. Some fraction of energy can be consumed to induce lattice vibrations (phonons). Statistically the relative resolution can be described by following equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta E}{E} = 2.35\sqrt{\frac{F\epsilon}{E}},
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the energy of the incoming particle, $\epsilon$ is the average energy required to produce a single pair, and $F$ is a Fano factor. The Fano factor is a special statistical constant that describes the dispersion in the counting process. If we consider the case of 14.4 keV gamma in Si ($\epsilon = 3.6$ eV, $F = 0.12$), the $\frac{\Delta E}{E}$ is equal to 1.3 $\%$ and $\Delta E$ is 185.4 eV. This resolution is sometimes called intrinsic, because the real resolution is much worse.

This resolution is sometimes called intrinsic, because the real resolution is much worse.




\subsection{Thermal noise}
It has been mentioned that the electrons can also be excited by thermal fluctuations. However, since many of the detector materials are indirect semiconductors, the thermal excitations are carried by the intermediate states within the band gap. These states originate from imperfections and impurities in the crystal lattice. The electrons and holes originating from this effect can join the charge cloud generated by the detected particle and reduce the SNR. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as dark current. Dark current is also increased by an applied bias.
\par
Thermal fluctuations are much more significant for materials that require less energy to excite the electrons to the conduction band, such as Ge. These detectors must always be operated at low temperatures. Even room temperature can lead to the breakdown and destruction of a detector. For Si, the valence and conduction bands are further from each other, so thermal fluctuations are not as critical.

%The thermal fluctuations are much more significant for materials which require less energy to excite the electrons to the conduction band such as Ge. These detectors always have to be operated at low temperatures. Even the room temperature can lead up to the breakdown and destruction of a detector. For Si, the valence and conduction band are more distant, so the thermal fluctuations are not so critical.


\subsection{Recombination and trapping}
The effect that counteracts successful carrier collection, and thus affects detection efficiency and energy resolution, is recombination. In pure crystals, the electron can only recombine with a hole if they have the same $\vec{k}$. However, in real crystals there are impurities that allow carriers to recombine - recombination centres. The charge collection must take much less time than the carriers need to recombine. 
\par
Another effect caused by the same impurities is trapping. The trapping centres capture the electron or hole and release it after a certain time. This effect alters the signal pulses and can reduce the maximum possible counting rate.
\par
Energy levels near the centre of the band gap are primarily responsible for recombination and trapping, which means that the impurities causing this are not the impurities added by doping, as these have their extra energy levels near the bands.

\section{Structure and parameters of Si PIN detector}
One of the most important parameters is the size of the photosensitive area, which must be as large as possible for effective radiation collection. This area must be treated with extreme care, as any damage, adsorption of impurities or condensation due to high ambient humidity will reduce the active photosensitive area.
\par
For detection purposes, the dimensions of all three layers (P, I and N) of the p-i-n semiconductor structure must be carefully designed. 
Obviously, the most important layer dimensions for the interactions within the detector are those parallel to the direction of incident radiation - the thicknesses of both the P and I regions.
The dead region (P) must be as thin as possible to reduce the probability that the particle will interact at a location where the generated charge cloud would recombine almost immediately. The active depleted layer (I) must be thick enough to allow all interactions to take place within itself. The schematic of a PIN photodiode can be seen in the figure \ref{SiPIN}.
%One of the most important parameter is the size of the photosensitive area, which has to be as large as possible for effective collection of radiation.
